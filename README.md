<p align="center">Caller Id: An app that can show you how you're called other's phones</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hops44/caller-id/master/Screenshot.jpg"/>

## Main Technologies Used
* ASP.NET MVC 4 for backend rest api
* Xamarin.Android for mobile app

## Features
* See how you're being called by other users
* See who calls you by nicknames
* Search a specific phone number and get results about that number's nicknames

I developed this app in order to familiarize myself with the xamarin platform and android development.
There is no authentication to the users because the app was built for demo purposes only.
